This project implements a basic supply chain optimization model using Python. It demonstrates how firms can minimise total operational costs by optimally allocating shipments between warehouses, distribution centres, and customers.

The notebook walks through:

Defining supply, demand, cost parameters, and capacity levels

Constructing the optimization problem using linear programming

Setting an objective function to minimise transportation or inventory cost

Adding realistic constraints such as demand fulfilment and capacity limits

Solving the model and analysing the optimal output

This repository is designed as a foundational template for learning or extending supply chain optimisation — useful for logistics, operations research, and data-driven decision-making use cases.
